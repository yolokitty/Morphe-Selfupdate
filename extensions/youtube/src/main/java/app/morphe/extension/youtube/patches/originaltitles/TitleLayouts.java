/**
 * Learns where the elements of each component show the title of the video,

 * such as the video lockups of some languages. The title found at a learned path is
 * only shown as loading until the title is verified, and is not replaced if it's not the title.
 * <p>
 * The field paths of the title depend on the component and on the app version, so they are learned
 * from the titles found in other ways, and from the titles that are not translated, which are
 * the same as the original title. Elements can show the title more than once, such as a visible
 * title and a title used by a command.
 * <p>
 * Components can have different layouts, such as a layout that shows a summary of the video
 * where other layouts show the title. A layout is the set of the field paths of the texts
 * of the element that are shown, and not keys or urls, as commands can include optional keys.
 * The title paths are learned for each layout, and a path is used for a layout if the title was
 * at the path in an element with the layout, no element with the layout had another text at the path,
 * and the title was at the path for different videos of the component.
